# Capstone-Project
Capstone Project for M.A.D.
This project is part of the assessment required in completing the Mobile Applications Development Module.
Students will be required to work on it Progressively on a weekly basis as they learn a new concept in M.A.D

# Scenario
I want to develop an android app for sharing recipes. When users open the app they will be able to select dishes from different cuisines, once they select a cuisine they would see a list of dishes (with a name of the dish, images, key ingredients and owner of the dish). Upon clicking on the dish they would be required to first register and only registered users would be able to see full information of the dish including how to prepare it.some of the additional/optional information on this section would be to allow users to share the recipe via different apps, Allow users to rate dishes, etc....For the chefs or recipe owners they would also have to register/login (for already registered users) and then be redirected to a screen where they would add the recipe/dish information.

# Instructions
 # Stage 1
 In this first phase you are required to identify all the requirements of this app, design the navigation flow, design mockups, define color schemes of this app,  and choose potential images to use. Add any other functionalities that you feel your current skills & knowledge allow you to do.
